# ARC Prize 2025 - Multi-Agent Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning System

## 🏆 Mission: Win the $1M ARC Prize 2025

This repository contains our enterprise-level solution for the ARC Prize 2025 competition - a multi-agent neuro-symbolic reasoning system designed to achieve human-level performance on abstract reasoning tasks.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

**Beyond Brute Force**: ARC tasks test fluid intelligence and algorithmic reasoning, not pattern recognition. Our solution is a program synthesis engine that hypothesizes, tests, and executes abstract transformation rules.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**"The key insight is that ARC tasks test fluid intelligence and algorithmic reasoning, not pattern recognition on massive data. They are libraries of past patterns, not engines for novel reasoning. Your solution must be a program synthesis engine or a reasoning agent that can hypothesize, test, and execute abstract transformation rules."**

Let's build the future of AGI reasoning! 🧠✨
